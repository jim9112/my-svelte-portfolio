		I’m a junior front-end developer looking for a new role in an exciting company. I mostly use
		React, but I can adapt to whatever tools are required. I’m based in Wilton, NH, but I’m happy
		working remotely and have experience in remote teams. When I’m not coding, you’ll find me
		cycling, hiking or skiing. I’d love you to check out my work.
